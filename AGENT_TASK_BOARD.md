## 📖 How to Use This Board

### For Agents (Task Doers):
1. **Read your section** below - find tasks where "Created By" is NOT you
2. **Skip any tasks with status** `🟡 Pending Review` - these are waiting for approval, don't work on them
3. **Pick a task** with status `⬜ New` or `❌ Blocked` and do the work
4. **When done**, change status from `⬜ New` → `🟡 Pending Review`
5. **Create a QA task** in the CREATOR's "Tasks I Created" table asking them to review
6. **Don't mark as complete** - only the creator can change to `✅ Done`

### For Task Creators:
1. **Add tasks** to others with "Created By" = your name
2. **Track in your "Tasks I Created" table** what you assigned to whom
3. **When you see a QA task** assigned to you, review the work
4. **If approved**: Change original task to `✅ Done`, close QA task
5. **If needs changes**: Add comments, send back to `⬜ New`

### Status Meanings:
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⬜ New | Not started or needs rework |
| 🟡 In Progress | Currently being worked on |
| 🟡 Pending Review | Done, waiting for creator approval |
| ✅ Done | Approved and complete |
| ❌ Blocked | Cannot proceed, needs help |

### Workflow Pattern (All on GitHub):
```
Creator adds task → Doer works → Doer marks "Pending Review" 
→ Doer creates QA task for Creator → Creator reviews
→ Creator approves → Creator marks "Done"
```

## 🔄 Example Workflow

### Scenario: PM needs analytics setup

**Step 1: PM creates task**
- PM adds to their "Tasks I Created": "QA: Review analytics setup" → assign to Developer
- PM adds to Developer's "My Tasks": "Install analytics" with "Created By: PM"

**Step 2: Developer does the work**
- Developer sees task in "My Tasks" (Created By: PM)
- Developer installs analytics

**Step 3: Developer requests review**
- Developer changes status: `⬜ New` → `🟡 Pending Review`
- Developer adds note: "GA4 installed, tracking page_view, sign_up events"
- Developer creates QA task in PM's "Tasks I Created" table: "Review analytics implementation"

**Step 4: PM reviews and approves**
- PM sees QA task in their "Tasks I Created"
- PM verifies analytics working
- PM changes original task: `🟡 Pending Review` → `✅ Done`
- PM closes QA task: `✅ Done`

**Result:** Full audit trail on GitHub, no messages needed!
